    <h1>WE ARE MANY WE ARE ONE IN CLIMATE CHANGE</h1>
    <div>While global leaders are in the COP26 meetings talking about how to tackle climate change, more and more activists are being threatened and killed for protecting the forests, waters, and biodiversity that our people and our planet are most in need of. The most vulnerable members of our human family are bearing the largest burden, dealing with the worst impacts of climate change and facing negative effects of ill-planned, top-down climate “solutions”.
    We know the choices we are making today will shape our communities, our economy, our health and the health of our planet for years to come, so let’s make sure our transition is towards a just economy that addresses integral human development. Human rights need to be respected and environmental harm avoided as we improve our global and national climate policies. We must make sure that people and the planet are at the centre of our just recovery.

        <h3>SCRIPTURE: James 1:19</h3>
        <br>A reading from the letter of James.<br/>
        <br>Every generous act of giving, with every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.  In fulfillment of his own purpose he gave us birth by the word of truth, so that we would become a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</br>
        <br>You must understand this, my beloved: let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.
    </br>
    The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God.
    <h4>A reading from the Encyclical Fratelli Tutti by Pope Francis</h4>

    <p>48. The ability to sit down and listen to others, typical of interpersonal encounters, is paradigmatic of the welcoming attitude shown by those who transcend narcissism and accept others, caring for them and welcoming them into their lives. Yet “today’s world is largely a deaf world… At times, the frantic pace of the modern world prevents us from listening attentively to what another person is saying. Halfway through, we interrupt him and want to contradict what he has not even finished saying. We must not lose our ability to listen”. Saint Francis “heard the voice of God, he heard the voice of the poor, he heard the voice of the infirm and he heard the voice of nature. He made of them a way of life. My desire is that the seed that Saint Francis planted may grow in the hearts of many”.[49]

    <p>49. As silence and careful listening disappear, replaced by a frenzy of texting, this basic structure of sage human communication is at risk. A new lifestyle is emerging, where we create only what we want and exclude all that we cannot control or know instantly and superficially. This process, by its intrinsic logic, blocks the kind of serene reflection that could lead us to a shared wisdom.</p>
